⭐ Features
	• 🔒 AES Encryption: Encrypts messages using AES-CBC mode before embedding them in images.
	• 🎨 LSB Steganography: Hides encrypted messages at the pixel level.
	• 📁 Image Upload & Download: Supports image upload, encoding/decoding, and downloading of encrypted images.
	• 🖥️ User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for an interactive experience.

📥 Installation
	1. Clone the repository: 
git clone https://github.com/chamu1999-Devi/Steganography.git
	2. Install dependencies: 
pip install streamlit opencv-python numpy pycryptodome
	3. Run the application: 
streamlit run stego.py

🛠 Usage
🔵 Encoding a Message
	1. Upload a PNG image.
	2. Enter a secret message.
	3. Provide a passcode for encryption.
	4. Click Encode & Save Image.
	5. Download the encrypted image.
🟢 Decoding a Message
	1. Upload the encrypted image.
	2. Enter the correct passcode.
	3. Click Decode Message.
	4. View the decrypted message.

🛡️ Security Considerations
	• AES encryption ensures message security.
	• Messages can only be retrieved using the correct passcode.
	• Ensure encrypted images are stored securely to prevent unauthorized access.

🔐 Best Practices for Security
	• Always use strong passcodes when encrypting messages.
	• Avoid sharing encrypted images on unsecured platforms.
	• Delete temporary files after decryption to maintain privacy.
	• Store encrypted images in secure locations to prevent unauthorized access.
