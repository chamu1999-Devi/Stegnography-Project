🛡️ Security Considerations
	• AES encryption ensures messages remain secure.
	• Messages can only be retrieved using the correct passcode.
	• Encrypted images should be stored securely to prevent unauthorized access.


🔐 Best Practices for Security
	• Use strong passcodes when encrypting messages.
	• Avoid sharing encrypted images on unsecured platforms.
	• Delete temporary files after decryption to maintain privacy.
	• Store encrypted images in secure locations to prevent unauthorized access.
